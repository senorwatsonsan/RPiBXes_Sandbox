Note:  In this demo I'm using IP adressess in the 199.185.13.0/24 range.  I'm only using them in my segmented lab environment. You won't find a STUN server at 199.185.13.100 (as far as I know, anyway), on the actual public internet.  At first, I was using TEST-NET addresses in the 203.0.113.0/24 range, but found myself running into automatic rules in the firewall blocking things.  I didn't want to run into any more lurking automatic rules like that, so I just found a valid public IP range and just used that in my little segmented sandbox.
